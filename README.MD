Reverse Polish Notation Calculator.
Construct Reverse Polish Notation from string and calculate it
Fork of https://github.com/kolosovpetro/RpnCalculator (I copypasted code from it yeps), but it is more compact (tests are removed, overal structure is squished). 
Also it is more compatible with older C# standards. It does not require to separate tokens with spaces.
